# ecommerce-data-analysis

In this project, I will be looking into a rich data set of ecommerce data, including order_item_refunds, order_items, orders, products, website_pageviews, website_sessions.


With the custom built ecommerce database, I will be extracting and analyzing data to generate insights. Below are some analysis I decided to work on as I believe these are key to an ecommerce.

1. Conversion rate from sessions to orders, grouped by quarters 
2. Conversion rate from sessions to orders, grouped by different traffic sources
3. Conversion funnel analysis, grouped by weeks
4. Clickthrough rates after reaching the /products page on an ecommerce page, and how it translates to orders
5. Product refunds analysis
6. Cross-Selling Analysis to find out which products buyers are purchasing together, thus offering smart recommendations
