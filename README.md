# ecommerce-data-analysis

In this project, I will be looking into a rich data set of ecommerce data, including order_item_refunds, order_items, orders, products, website_pageviews, website_sessions.


With the custom built ecommerce database, I will be extracting and analyzing data to generate insights. I will be mainly doing analysis on website traffic, wesbite performance, business patterns and seasonality, as well as some product analysis and user analysis.
